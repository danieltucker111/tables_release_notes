## Release Version 1.6.5 (4/19/2023)

#### We've introduced new features to help Tables be even more strategic!

This latest release has powerful new tools that will help Tables ideate, capture, synthesize, and activate the most important choices for driving strategies forward. We are in the process of writing training material for each of the features below and will notify you as they are ready. For now, we want to let you know what they are.

#### New Feature: Conversations

Strategic conversations are core to Table meetings. These key conversations are what keep Tables thriving and decisions moving. With the JoD Conversations tool, Tables can plan key conversations well in advance (and collaboratively if desired). Doing so can help Tables in many ways:&#x20;

* Create a list of the “most important things” this Table will address for the next quarter, year, etc.&#x20;
* Tag conversations as Now, Next, Future
* Order the list of conversations
* Capture ongoing notes for each conversation – memorializing agreements
* Ability to link one or more DTBMs to a given conversation in order to better understand the connection between conversations, DTBMs, and strategies.

#### New Feature: Table Planner

Thriving Tables require continuous nurturing, including thoughtful planning between meetings. The Table Planner is a single place to organize and link a Table's active Conversations, Decisions-to-be-Made (DTBMs), and upcoming Table Meeting Agendas.

* More strategically sequence meetings and topics around active conversations and DTBMs.&#x20;
* Ability to plan meetings well in advance.
* Make visible to Table members an always up-to-date and holistic view of a Table’s plan.&#x20;
* Know who (other than existing Table members) to invite to the conversation (meeting) well in advance.

#### New Feature: Sensemaking

Turn responses to a Capture Board topic into meaningful, actionable information. Group content in real-time to advance strategic conversations with a powerful new tool for sensemaking. Once you’ve completed a list of responses to a topic, you can send it to the Sensemaking tool where you can collaboratively:

* Create groupings (buckets)&#x20;
* Move responses into buckets&#x20;
* Rename or delete an existing bucket&#x20;
* Rename or delete existing responses (e.g., removing duplicates)&#x20;
* Add new responses&#x20;
* Rename your topic
* Export the final version of the distilled topic where it can be shared to an agenda or copied and shared anywhere.

#### Changes to the Agenda Builder

We’ve noticed that accessing the notes section of the agenda at the beginning of a meeting has been a bit of a pain for Table Conveners and note takers. Well, hopefully we’ve fixed that. Now the notes section is visible all of the time – even when empty, so that Conveners and note takers can get started right away. We’ve also moved the meeting-related strategies to the top section along with the meeting purpose. And, we’ve added the ability to link related Conversations to the agenda, similar to (and right next to) linked DTBMs.

#### New Feature: In-Application Notifications

Finally, we’ve created an in-application notification system. Its primary benefits are to reduce the amount of email clutter and still allow you all to stay up-to-date with new features, productivity hacks, training tips, etc. These notifications can be permanently dismissed or you can just click the close \[X] and we’ll remind you again in 24 hours.
